# ProjectBabble
A Mouth tracking system for VR, 100% Opensource!

Currently, the architecture is a modified efficientnetv2-b0 model (although we actively look into other architectures and models) training on blendshapes from ARKit (with some of our own modifcations to the ARKit standard)!  The model outputs 45 blenshapes of which most cross over with SRanipals blendshapes.
