# ProjectBabble
A Mouth tracking system for VR, 100% Opensource!

Currently the architecture is a modified mobilenetv3-large training on blenshapes from ARKit! The model outputs 33 blenshapes of which most cross over with SRanipals blendshapes.

### A few things to note
1. The current version of the model may not work for your mouth as it has been trained on a not very diverse dataset. Expect this to change in newer versions. 
2. Not all blendshapes may work as there isnt enough data collected in the dataset. 
3. This model is not a 1 to 1 translation to SRanipal blenshapes. While most blendshapes do cross over with SRanipal cheek and tounge movements are limited.
